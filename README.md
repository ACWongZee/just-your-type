# Just your type

## Overview

- Select a quote, passage of poetry, chunk of lyrics, excerpt from a book, famous tweet, etc.
  <br>*No adult themes, graphic language, illegal text, or hate speech.*
  <br>Must be a **minimum of two sentences**—more the better to allow you to fully explore a design.
- Design a creative webpage using HTML & CSS only. **No images.**
- Make it responsive and interesting with thoughtful use of colour, type & responsiveness.
- **Consider it a type project—and not just a website.**
- Thoughtfully choose a type scale—not just the default, unless you can justify your reason.
- Be creative. Use modular CSS to push your concept.
- *Some inspiration:* [100 Days of Type](http://100daysoffonts.com/), [Typewolf](http://www.typwolf.com)
